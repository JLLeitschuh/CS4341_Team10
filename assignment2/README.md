Assignment #2
Due date:  Friday, September 25, 2015 @ 11:59 p.m.
Team 10: Nam Tran, Triet Pham, Jonathan Leitschuh, Isamu Nakagawa

#Goal
This assignment will familiarize you with genetic algorithms (GA).  You will solve a variety of problems to learn about representation (the biggest challenge for GA).  You will also conduct experiments with a couple of variants of GA to see how they affect performance.
